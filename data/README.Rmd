## cleaned
# This subfolder has 20 csv files

`trade2000_2020.csv`: This is the cleaned dataset for total product trade produced from five csv files extracted from the bulk file (BIMTS_HS2017_2D_CSV_1995_To_2023) with the code '_T'.
`total_edgelist.csv`: This is an edgelist created from `trade2000_2020.csv`.

`dyads_fixed.csv`: This is a cleaned dataset produced from dist_cepii data. It records time invariant dyadic variables, like, common language, common colonizer, distance etc. 
`nodal_fixed.csv`: This is cleaned dataset produced from geo_cepii data, which has node level time invariant factors like landlockedness, primary language, continent, longitude, latitue etc. 
`fixed.csv`: This file is produced from above 2 files nestedly indexing on the country pairs and records all time invariants factors for both dyadic and nodal level. This will be used in the gravity equation estimation. 

`rta_long.csv`: This is the dyad level RTA dataset in the long format.
`rta_edgelist.csv`: This is dyadic level time variant edgelist created from `rta_long.csv`.

`emission_trade2000_2020.csv`: long format emission data created from `DF_TRADE.csv`

`contiguity_edgelisst.csv`: This is dyadic contiguity edgelist created from `fixed.csv`.
`colonizer_edgelist.csv`: This is dyadic past colony-colonizer edgelist created from `fixed.csv`.
`comcol_edgelist.csv`: This is dyadic common colonizer edgelist created from `fixed.csv`.
`language_edgelist.csv`: This is dyadic language edgelist created from `fixed.csv`.

`internet.csv`: cleaned internet penetration data as an edglelist
`internet_long.csv`: `internet.csv` stacked to long format
`gdp_pct.csv`: cleaned GDP per capita data as an edglelist

`schooling.csv`: mean year of schooling in ong format
`nodal_time_series.csv`: merge of schooling, internet and gdp per capita datsets

`attributeYEAR.csv': There are 24 files like this name. These are the time varying nodal attributes merged on the fixed attributes created for node attributes of the network objects.
`attributes2000_2023.csv`: This is the time series node attributes data in the long format used to build the panel dataset.
`attribute_centrality_long`: This is a csv file that contains the attribute dataset added with the network centralities of the countries over time.
